# polbreaking-ai

The old @polbreaking bot was a Twitter bot that notified of happenings on 4chan's /pol/ board. It used static rules that said what is a happening and what is not (like counting the reply rate), and thus needed up to an hour before triggering a tweet.

This is a complete rewrite of this bot. The goal is to have something that recognizes happening post as similar to past happening posts as they are posted and thus triggers immediately!

We will use ML and NLP techniques.
